# qhack23_project
 - Team name: QuantuMother
 - In this Readme.md for QHack 2023 `project name`, we are including notebooks or pdfs in this repository. This repository will contain the entire project.

## Rough idea
1. We want to implement the quantum feature map (QEK) in reference [1], where they demonstrate a competitive result in classifying graph-structured datasets compared to graph neural networks (GNN). 
2. We can implement quantum GNN for the same classification tasks.

## Getting started
1. 

Useful demo:
